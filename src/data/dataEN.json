        "Hogar San Blas de Nicoya, dedicated to the care of elderly individuals, is located in the central canton of Nicoya, Guanacaste. It was established out of the need to support elderly people who, in a state of abandonment and need, were forced to beg on the streets. A group of generous community members, united by a desire to help, voluntarily began the process of providing assistance.",
        "The nursing home officially opened in September 1983, initially operating as a day center. Over time, it evolved into a long-term care facility, increasing the number of residents served. Currently, the home accommodates between 36 and 40 elderly adults—men and women aged between 65 and 102. At various times, the home has cared for individuals even older, often lacking resources, facing illness, or in terminal stages."

        "Hogar San Blas de Nicoya has a rich history spanning decades and has been a pillar of support for the Guanacaste community. Founded with the mission to provide care and attention to elderly adults, it has become a beacon of hope and compassionate service in the region. Since its inception, the facility has evolved to meet the changing needs of its residents, offering a homelike environment that promotes dignity and respect. Today, it continues its commitment to excellence in geriatric care, recognized for its unwavering dedication to improving the quality of life for those who call Hogar San Blas their home.",
      "The home continues to operate thanks to community volunteers, whose contributions helped build the first wing and hallway between 1983 and 1991. Later, the facility was completed with support from INA, JPS, CTAMS, IMAS, the Municipality, and the people of Nicoya. Today, the nursing home features a fully equipped kitchen, dining room, chapel, 24 rooms in three wings, an activity hall, physical therapy room, nursing and wound care department, offices for social services, nutrition, administration, an outdoor recreation and event area, large green spaces, and a farm with animals used as therapy for the elderly. A volunteer program is still active, and financial support is also provided by institutions such as the Social Protection Board (Junta de Protección Social), CONAPAM, FODESAF, as well as the Board of Directors' own fundraising efforts and ongoing community support. In 2011, the Home launched the Home-Based Care Network program (Red de Cuido), which serves elderly individuals living in extreme poverty in their own homes. Initially supporting 50 beneficiaries, the program now assists 125 elderly adults through CONAPAM funding."
