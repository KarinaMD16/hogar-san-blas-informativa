    "descripcion": "The Hogar San Blas of Nicoya is dedicated to the care of older adults and is located in the central canton of Nicoya, Guanacaste. It was born out of the need to care for elderly individuals who, abandoned and in need, were forced to beg on the streets. A generous group of community members, moved by compassion, began voluntary efforts to help. The Nursing Home officially opened in September 1983, initially operating as a Day Center. Over time, it evolved into a long-term care home, gradually increasing the number of residents. Today, it cares for between 36 and 40 older adults, both men and women, ranging from 65 to 102 years of age. Some residents have even been older, often lacking resources, suffering from illnesses, or in terminal stages of life. The home continues to operate thanks to community volunteers, whose efforts led to the construction of the first pavilion and corridor between 1983 and 1991. Later, with support from INA, JPS, C.T.A.M.S, IMAS, the Municipality, and the people of Nicoya, the full facility was completed. Today, the hogar San Blas features a fully equipped kitchen, dining room, chapel, 24 rooms distributed in three pavilions, an activity hall, a physical therapy room, a nursing and medical care department, offices for social services, nutrition, administration, an outdoor recreation and events area, large green spaces, and even a farm with animals used as part of therapy for older adults. The Home still benefits from a strong volunteer network and receives financial support from institutions such as the Social Protection Board (Junta de Protección Social), CONAPAM, FODESAF, as well as from its own fundraising efforts and community support. In 2011, the Home implemented the Home Care Network Program (Red de Cuido), which serves older adults living in extreme poverty in their own homes. Initially supporting 50 beneficiaries, the program now serves 125 older adults with the help of resources provided by CONAPAM."
